### Introduction

Laravel Boilerplate provides you with a massive head start on any size web application. Out of the box it has features like a backend built on CoreUI with Spatie/Permission authorization. It has a frontend scaffold built on Bootstrap 4. Other features such as Two Factor Authentication, User/Role management, searchable/sortable tables built on my [Laravel Livewire tables plugin](https://github.com/rappasoft/laravel-livewire-tables), user impersonation, timezone support, multi-lingual support with 20+ built in languages, demo mode, and much more.
